# WHMCS Automatically Mark Ticket for Support Agent

A helper that automatically marks a ticket in progress and for the current support agent either by
pressing the **Mark for me** button or by typing in the reply textbox. 

Both of these can be controlled by setting the relevant variables ```$showButton``` and ```$onTextChange``` to true or false at the beginning of the function.



## How to install

1. Copy the ```includes``` folder to your root WHMCS directory.
2. Press the **Mark for me** button or start typing in the reply textbox on a ticket (depending on which is enabled)
